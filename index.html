                <h2 >Past:</h2>
            <p > Five years of experience in IT-related roles has given me
                a clear perspective on the next steps in my career. I've
                had a range of experiences, from highly technical tasks 
                to strategic roles where I've assisted sales teams in 
                launching new products, designed effective user training
                plans, and worked with multidisciplinary teams. I've been
                fortunate to do three things I enjoy most: helping people,
                using computers, and solving problems. However, there is
                a limit to how many people I can reach, how many problems 
                I can solve, and the impact I can make with my current 
                skill set. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="red" >
                <h2>Present:</h2>
            <p > Going college feels like a natural progression in my career.
                I want to acquire more specialized skills that will enable me to
                do things I couldn't do before. In addition to my academic 
                education, I frequently find myself involved in personal 
                projects. Whether it's working with microcontrollers, 
                deploying open-source programs on my home server, or fine-tuning 
                an LLM, I enjoy learning by doing. This very website is evidence 
                of that; just two weeks ago, I didn't even know what CSS was or 
                how to code in HTML.<br> During these four years, I hope to find 
                internship opportunities where I can apply, in a practical or 
                even creative way, the concepts I'm learning in class.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="red" >
                <h2>Future:</h2>
            <p > From now on, I will start working towards specific goals. 
                I aim to enter fields like Data Science, Machine Learning, 
                and AI. For me, it's not just about the technology itself; it's 
                about scaling my reach and impacting more people by providing 
                solutions that improve their lives in one way or another.    </p>
