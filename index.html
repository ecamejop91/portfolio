                <h2 >Past:</h2>
            <p > With five years in IT, I've gained a broad skill set, from technical 
                roles to strategic initiatives like aiding in new product launches and 
                creating effective user training programs. I've collaborated across 
                multidisciplinary teams, enjoying my three passions: helping people, using technology, 
                and problem-solving. However, there's a limit to the impact I can have
                 with my current skills, pointing me towards the next steps in my career. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="red" >
                <h2>Present:</h2>
            <p > Returning to college feels like a natural progression in my career.
                I want to acquire more specialized skills that will enable me to
                do things I couldn't do before. In addition to my academic 
                education, I frequently find myself involved in personal 
                projects. Whether it's working with microcontrollers, 
                deploying open-source programs on my home server, or fine-tuning 
                an LLM, I enjoy learning by doing. This very website is evidence 
                of that.<br> During these four years, I hope to find 
                internship opportunities where I can apply, in a practical or 
                even creative way, the concepts I'm learning in class.</p>

            <div class="red" >
                <h2>Future:</h2>
            <p > From now on, I will start working towards specific goals. 
                I aim to enter fields like Data Science, Machine Learning, 
                and AI. For me, it's not just about the technology itself; it's 
                about scaling my reach and impacting more people by providing 
                solutions that improve their lives in one way or another.    </p>
